            <h4>Charlie Kelly</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>Charlie is an easily excitable individual who is prone to emotional outbursts and is often confused and flabbergasted by modern-day life. His anger management issues, substance abuse, poor hygiene, lack of common sense, illiteracy, and poor grasp of reality prevent him from achieving much success in life. He also frequently eats cat food before bed, to induce a feeling of sickness and drowsiness that allows him to fall asleep rapidly, which his roommate Frank also does. </p>

              <h4>Frank Reynolds</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>Frank is the legal father of twins Dennis and Dee and the roommate, ex-husband, and alleged biological father of Charlie. Frank appears to be intelligent relative to the rest of The Gang, but is quite possibly mentally unstable. He frequently becomes paranoid, delusional and psychotic. He has also attempted suicide several times, and has consumed a large quantity and variety of drugs throughout the series. Frank styles himself as a master manipulator and frequently takes the lead in The Gang's schemes.</p>

              <h4>Dennis Reynolds</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>Dennis is Deandra's twin brother and co-owner of Paddy's. He is narcissistic, selfish, histrionic and vain, perpetuated by his Ivy League education at the University of Pennsylvania. Dennis is repeatedly implied to be a sociopath, and was diagnosed with borderline personality disorder and prescribed medication. His sense of self-worth is entirely dependent on what others think of his appearance.</p>

              <h4>Mac</h4>
              <hr>
              <p>Ronald "Mac" McDonald is Charlie Kelly's childhood friend and Dennis's high school friend and later roommate. He is a co-owner of Paddy's and its bouncer. He brags about his incredible hand-to-hand combat skills, strength, and general athletic ability though it is quite obvious he lacks any real skill or even a proper sense of balance. His full name is Ronald McDonald, but he goes by "Mac".</p>
